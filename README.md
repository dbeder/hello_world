# hello_world
here's a description, wheee<br>
I'm not sure I like editing in a browser. I'm always worried that I'll lose my work. Notepad is more comforting.<br>
Guess there's no spell checker hooked up.<br>
<p>I assume the clipboard icon represents a commit button. too bad there's no hover text that explains that. Maybe someone at MS will get that updated. Hmm, that button didn't seem to do anything so maybe it's not a commit button... so what the heck is it?</p>
Found the commit button, it's way the heck at the bottom of the screen. didn't see it as I have to scroll the whole page and not an inner edit control page.<br> just changed this line in master.
Adding this new line in master.
